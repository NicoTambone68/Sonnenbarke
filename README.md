Introduction
------------


## Tuple Space


A tuple space is a shared memory space which can be accessed concurrently. This memory space provides a repository for tuples.
A set of primitive methods are able to operate on the repository for reading, writing and searching data.
A tuple space is a kind of associative memory. An associative memory is accessed by its content and type rather than its address.
This kind of memory is suitable to describe parallel algorithms without referring to a specific computer architecture.
